JSON used and worked well
Jquery used and worked well (two main Jquery actions excluding $.getJSON: calculate quiz score, reduced opacity of all images not checked)


Extra Credit: 
1) Button cycles through colors on hover via https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39725592/loop-div-background-color-through-all-rainbow-colors-gradually-css
2) Where should Javascript be place in file? At bottom of body because file loads header first then body top to bottom. Therefore, if Javascript is placed at the bottom of the body, 
a) Javascript's loaded last which in turn means the basic visuals (HTML) can be seen by viewer quicker 
b) prevents certain errors (ex. Javascript functions acting on HTML elements that don't exist yet)
